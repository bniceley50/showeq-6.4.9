/*
 * VPacket
 *
 * VPacket is a generic class that allows recording and playback of
 * generic data with timestamps.  The data is stored in binary format
 * with headers around it so that it is retrieved in the same manner 
 * (exact same 'chunks') that it was sent.  This makes a good class for
 * a packet capture
 *
 * The following public member functions are available:
 *
 * Plaback(...)                Fetch data from the buffer
 * Record(...)                 Record data to the buffer
 * Flush()                     Force a flush of data to the file
 * setPlaybackSpeed()          Set a playback rate (0=not timed, 1=1X, etc)
 * playbackSpeed()             Get the playback rate
 * EndOfData()                 Check for out of data
 *
 *
 * The intention of this class was to capture network packets to play back
 * at a later time.  Using without a file is untested, as well as using to
 * Fetch and Record simultaneously.  These features may not be implemented
